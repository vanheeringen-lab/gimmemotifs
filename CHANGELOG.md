# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## Unreleased

### Changed

- updated dependencies (conda + pypi)

### Fixed

- `gimme motifs` uses `--ncpus` where possible (two more places). fixes #265
- pinned pandas >=1.3, <2 
  - Styler.render() was deprecated for Styler.to_html(), but that throws an error

## [0.18.0] - 2023-01-11

### Added

- `gimme scan` and `gimme maelstrom` now accept a random seed for (most) operations
  - for (optimal) deterministic behaviour, delete the cache and then run the command with a seed 
- `Scanner` now accepts a `np.random.RandomState` and `progress` on init.
  - `progress=None` (the default) should print progress bars to the command line only, not to file.
- `Scanner.set_genome` now accepts the optional argument `genomes_dir`
- `gimmemotifs.maelstrom.Moap.create` now accepts a `np.random.RandomState`.
- `gimmemotifs.maelstrom.run_maelstrom` now accepts a `np.random.RandomState`.

### Changed

- `gimme diff` (`diff_plot()` to be exact) will now print to stdout, like all other functions
- now using the logger instead of print/sys.stderr.write in many more places
- string formatting now (mostly) done with f-strings
- refactored Fasta class
- split `scanner.py` into 3 submodules:
  - `scanner/__init__.py` with the exported functions
  - `scanner/base.py` with the Scanner class
  - `scanner/utils.py` with the rest
- `gimmemotifs/maelstrom.py` renamed to `gimmemotifs/maelstrom/_init__.py`
  - `rank.py` and `moap.py` are now submodules of maelstrom.

### Fixed

- `gimme maelstrom` works with or without xgboost (but will give a warning without xgboost) 
- fixed warning "in validate_matrix(): Row sums in df are not close to 1. Reormalizing rows..."
- fixed multiprocess.Pool Warnings
- fixed a pandas copywarning (in `gc_bin_bedfile()` to be exact)
- fixed warnings when leaving files open
- fixed deprecation warning in maelstrom (and in tests)
- fixed futurewarning in report.py 
- silence warnings from external tools in motif prediction (`pp_predict_motifs()` to be exact)
- updated last references from `Motif.pwm_scan` and `Motif.pwm_scan_all` to `Motif.scan` and `Motif.scan_all` respectively
- typo in `gimme motifs` output ("%matches background" to "% matches background")
- `Scanner` now uses a cheaper method to determine a genome's identity 
  - (filesize + name instead of the md5sum of the whole genome's contents)
- `gimme motifs` gives an informative error when `fraction` is not within 0-1.
- `gimme threshold` works again

### Removed

- removed old python2 code (scanning with MOODS & import shenanigans)

## [0.17.2] - 2022-10-12

### Changed

- made xgboost an optional dependency (to save space on bioconda)
- an existing config will now update available tools when accessed (e4b3275)
- applied the bioconda patch to compile_externals.py (11b0c2c)
- `coverage_table` and `combine_peaks` have their positional arguments under positional arguments (20819ee)
- `coverage_table` should be slightly faster now (20819ee)

### Fixed

- biofluff dependency back in requirements
- pinned conda and mamba versions in `.travis.yaml`
  - temp fix until conda>=4.12 can install mamba properly
- documentation is working again!
- gimmemotifs now supports pandas >=1.30

### Removed

- pyarrow dependency


## [0.17.1] - 2022-06-02

### Added

- `requirements.yaml` contains all conda dependencies.
  - packages available from one channel have been pinned (for solving speed)
  - packages have minimum versions where known (for solving speed)

### Changed

- alphabetized tools everywhere (how could you live like that!?)
- updated `setup.py`
- updated installation instructions

### Fixed

- Yamda is now recognized in the config
- most tools work with the editable installation again 
- all tests work for unix
  - there were still some flakey values, where randomness is involved.
- background.py updated to work with the specified minimum `genomepy` version
- all `sphinx-build docs build` warnings
- motifs require to have unique ids when clustering, thanks @akmorrow13!
- motif2factors removes apostrophes so it wont crash :)
- removed a print

### Removed

- a bunch of redundant requirement files.
- OSX tests. Possibly temporary.
  - The tests haven't working for ages, so I have no idea where to begin.
  - and Travis asks 5x credits for OSX machines...


## [0.17.0] - 2021-12-22

### Added

* Added `--genomes_dir` argument to `gimme motif2factors`.
* Added `--version` flag.
* Function `sample()` for fast sequence sampling from a `Motif()` instance.
* Added JASPAR 2022 motif databases.
* Updated Homer motif database.
* Operators:
  * `+` - take the combination of two motifs (average), based on pfm, which means that motifs with higher counts will be weighed more heavily.
  * `&` - take the combination of two motifs (average), based on the ppm, which means that both motifs will be weighed equally.
  * `<<` - "shift" motif left (adding a non-informative position to the right side)
  * `>>` - "shift" motif right (adding a non-informative position to the left side)
  * `~` - reverse complement
  * `*` - multiply the pfm by a value
* Progress bar for scanning.
* `list_installed_libraries()` to list available motif libraries.

### Changed

* `Motif()` class completely restructured:
  * Split into multiple files with coherent function.
  * Uses `numpy.array` internally.
  * All functions that mention `pwm` renamed to `ppm` (position-probability matrix), as the definition of a PWM is usually a log-odds matrix, not a probability matrix.
    * `to_pwm()` is deprecated, use `to_ppm()` instead.
  * Changed functions `pwm_min_score()` and `pwm_max_score()` to properties `max_score` and `min_score`.
  * All internal data is correctly updated when `Motif()` is changed, for instance by trimming (#218).


### Fixed

* `gimme motif2factors` can now unzip genome fastas.
* `gimme motif2factors` will sanitize genome names.
* Fixed bugs related to partial rerun of `gimme motif2factors`.
* Fixed unhandled `OSError` during installation on Mac.
* Fixed bug related to `RFE()` (#226).
* Positional probability matrix now sum to 1 over all positions (#209).
* Fixed issue with pandas >= 1.3.
* Fixed issue with `non_reducing_slice` import from pandas.
* Fix threshold calculation if more than 20,000 sequences are supplied.
* Fix issue with config file getting corrupted.
* Fix FPR threshold calculation.

- Motif scan results for non-redundant motifs are now included in the output.
- Plot motif logos using different styles of visualization (information content, frequency, energy or [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.info/2018/10/15/new-ensembl-motif-features/)).
- New scoring scheme that uses a z-score based on genomic sequences with a similar GC%. 
- CIS-BP motif database version 2.0 ([Lambert et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0411-1)).

- The `xl` motif setting (motif width 6-20) is selected by default for `gimme motifs`. 
- Output names for files and reports of `gimme motifs` are now more consistent.

## [0.12.0] - 2018-07-10

**Please note:** the way GimmeMotifs uses genome FASTA files has changed in a
major way. It is no longer necessary to index genomes. GimmeMotifs now uses the
`faidx` index. You can use [genomepy](http://github.com/simonvh/genomepy) to
manage your genomes.

### Added

- Release checklist (for developer use).
- Helpful message when the genome cannot be found.
- Added a `-N/--nthreads` option to command-line tools to specify the number of
  threads independent from the config file.
- Added a `npcus` argument to many functions.
- Support for the `feather` data format as input for `gimme maelstrom`.
- Progress bar and resume option for maelstrom.
- Motif database is copied to maelstrom output directory.
- Added `MaelstromResult` class to work with maelstrom output.

### Changed

- Moved rank aggregation to separate function.
- Parallel implementation of rank aggregation.
- Updated documentation on how to add genomes in the new version.
- Switched to using `faidx` for FASTA indexing and `genomepy` for genome
  management.

### Removed

- The `gimme index` script (replaced by `genomepy`).

### Fixed

- Upload with correct description to PyPi.
- Fixed warning of `ks_pvalue` when `p == 0`.
- Fixed issue with nested multiprocessing pools.
- Fix numpy version because of DeprecationWarning in sklearn.
- Updated xgboost dependency, where the API had changed.
