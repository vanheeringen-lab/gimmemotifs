            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <h4>MAST is a tool for searching biological sequence databases for
              sequences that contain one or more of a group of known motifs.</h4>

            <p>A motif is a sequence pattern that occurs repeatedly in a group
            of related protein or DNA sequences. Motifs are represented as
            position-dependent scoring matrices that describe the score of each
            possible letter at each position in the pattern. Individual motifs
            may not contain gaps. Patterns with variable-length gaps must be
            split into two or more separate motifs before being submitted as
            input to MAST.</p>

            <p>MAST takes as <a href="mast-input.html">input</a> a file
            containing the descriptions of one or more motifs and searches a
            sequence database that you select for sequences that match the
            motifs. The motif file can be the output of the <a href=
            "meme-intro.html">MEME</a> motif discovery tool or any file in the
            appropriate format.</p>

            <p>MAST outputs details on the <a 
              href="mast-output.html#sequences_doc">top scoring sequences</a> 
            ordered by score. The score is calculated as the strength of the 
            <a href="mast-output.html#combined">combined match</a> of the 
            sequence to all motifs. The basic details shown include the 
            sequence name, <i>E</i>-value indicating the match strength and 
            the strong motif occurrences shown in the form of a <a 
              href="mast-output.html#diagrams">block diagram</a>. 
            <a href="mast-output.html#expanded_results">Expanded details</a> 
            available include the sequence comment, combined <i>p</i>-value and 
            <a href="mast-output.html#annotation">annotated sequence</a>.</p>
      
            <p>MAST works by calculating <a href="mast-output.html#score">match
            scores</a> for each sequence in the database compared with each of
            the motifs in the group of motifs you provide.  For each sequence,
            the match scores are converted into various types of <a href=
            "mast-output.html#pvalues">p-values</a> and these are used to
            determine the overall match of the sequence to the group of motifs
            and the probable order and spacing of occurrences of the motifs in
            the sequence.
