                      <li><b>Motif Analysis of Large DNA Datasets</b><br />
                      The MEME-ChIP service allows submission of a FASTA file of DNA sequences
                      of unlimited size and with minimal parameter settings (only the traditional
                      MEME web form settings) and runs it through a variety of motif finding and
                      analysis tools.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                      <code>dreme</code> --<br />
                      added <code>dreme</code> and integrated it into the MEME-ChIP into web service.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                      <code>AME</code> --<br />
                      added <code>ame</code> and integrated it into the MEME-ChIP into web service. This
                      is a cut-down version of the <code>ame</code> previously described, only supporting one mode
                      of motif enrichment analysis.

                      <code>fasta-dinucleotide-shuffle</code> --<br />
                      added <code>scripts/fasta-dinucleotide-shuffle</code> and integrated it into the MEME-ChIP into web service.
                      Thanks to Peter Clote for allowing use of his dinucleotide shuffle code.

                    The web interface and documentation is currently rather limited but in the interests of 
                    getting this out for review this is a preview edition of the <b>Spaced Motif analysis tool</b>.

                  <li>
                    <code>FIMO</code> -- <br />
                      The <code>FIMO</code> HTML output now explicitly labels the strand,
                      rather than indicating the reverse strand by having <cdoe>start</cdoe>
                      &gt; than <code>stop</code>.
                      The HTML output also now includes the matched sequence.
                      The GFF output is now GFF 3.

                <code>Tomtom</code> --<br />
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Search multiple databases</b><br />
                  Tomtom can now search more than one motif database. 
                  To keep the ability to have web links for each motif
                  they were moved into the MEME motif format itself.
                  See the <a href="tomtom.html">documentation</a>.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Improvements in submission form</b><br />
                  Tomtom's submission form has many new enhancements.
                  Motifs can now be specified in 3 formats: IUPAC motifs,
                  frequency matrices, and MEME format files.
                  Go <a href="../cgi-bin/tomtom.cgi">try it</a>.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Improvements in output format</b><br />
                  Tomtom now outputs an XML file which it converts into
                  the HTML output. The HTML output can dynamically
                  draw the motif logos when the images aren't available
                  on web browsers supporting HTML5. Additional improvements
                  include a summary table at the top giving direct links to the
                  top 20 matches for each motif. See the 
                  <a href="examples/tomtom_example_output_files/tomtom.html">sample</a>.

                </li>
                <li><code>FIMO</code> --<br />
                The output for FIMO now includes a 
                <a href="https://cgwb.nci.nih.gov/goldenPath/help/wiggle.html">wiggle track format file</a>.
                </li>
                <li>MEME file format --<br />
                The MEME file format now includes an optional URL for each motif. This is used
                to create the links in the Tomtom output. All the XXXX2meme scripts have been
                retrofitted to take this URL parameter.
                </li>
                <li>
                <code>ama-qvalues</code> --<br />
                New script. See the <a href="ama-qvalues.html">documentation</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                <code>fasta-subsample</code> --<br />
                New script for extracting a random sampling of the sequences
                in a FASTA file.  This is especially useful for ChIP-seq
                peak datasets to be input to MEME.  Using this script, a
                FASTA file containing a subset of the ChIP-seq peak sequences
                (or any other FASTA file) can be created.  The total
                number of sequences should be less than 1000 (preferably less
                than 500), and the total sequence length should be less
                than a few hundred thousand. MEME typically takes about 20 minutes
                per motif with files of 100,000 characters (DNA, both strands, ZOOPS model), 
                and scales quadratically in the total sequence length (so a file of
                200,000 characters will take four times as long.)
                This new script can also output the remaining sequences (in a seperate
                file) for use in cross-validation. See the <a href="fasta-subsample.html">documentation</a>.

                  now been integrated into the MEME Suite web applications.
                  MCAST is a tool for searching for 
                  statistically significant clusters of motifs in DNA sequences.
                  MCAST was previously supported on a separate web site.

                  <li><b> Discriminative motif discovery </b> <br />
                  The MEME web server now supports discriminative
                  motif discovery. The user may now provide a set 
                  of "negative sequences" in addition to the normal
                  "positive sequences", and MEME will look for 
                  motifs that are overrepresented in the positive sequences
                  relative to the negative sequences.
                  </li>
                  <li><b> Improvements in output format </b> <br />
                  MEME's html output (<a href="examples/meme_example_output_files/meme.html">sample</a>) has been reorganised to 
                  make important information more accessible as well as to make it aesthetically pleasing. Some of the improvements 
                  include:<br />
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        A preview of the motifs found, including their reverse complement for DNA, in miniature at the top of the page.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Ability to view full sized reverse-complemented DNA logos.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Highlighting of all output for a sequence with a single click.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        New block diagrams that graphically show the strength (and DNA strand) of motifs, 
                        and that scale with the size of the browser window.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Support for the new web standard HTML5. This allows the motif logos to be viewed without the images
                        on supporting web browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari). Unfortunately Opera has inadequate text support for canvas 
                        (the new HTML5 element required for this feat) and Internet Explorer currently doesn't support canvas at all. 
                        It is anticipated that Internet Explorer 9 will support this feature.

                    MAST's html output (<a href="examples/mast_example_output_files/mast.html">sample</a>) has been reorganised to 
                    make important information more accessible as well as to make it aesthetically pleasing. Some of the improvements 
                    include:<br />
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Everything is now in one place - no longer do you have to search to find the associated annotated sequence for that
                        high scoring sequence, as with one click the hidden information is displayed directly below. Additionally if DNA 
                        strands are scored separately then the sequence only appears in the list once based on the better scoring strand.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        New block diagrams - incorporating all the improvements in the new MEME block diagrams such as graphical display of
                        motif strength, scaling with the browser window and the DNA strand. As an added bonus separately scored strands 
                        are visible on the same diagram.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Interactive annotated sequence - a new range selector allows you to view the sequence around the motif hits of your 
                        choice, directly relatable to the block diagram. For separate DNA strand scoring only one strand is visible at a time.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Now in colour - the annotated sequence for motif hits now have letters colour coded using the same colour scheme 
                        as MEME motifs.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> MAST now outputs xml in a similar fashion to MEME. This has resulted in differences to how you would invoke MAST
                    from the <a href="mast.html">command line</a>. Additionally it no longer has the script wrapper.
                    </li>
                    <li>MAST now uses an xml style sheet to create its html output.
                    </li>

                </li>
                <li>
                <code>mast2txt</code> --<br />
                  Created program <a href="mast2txt.html">mast2txt</a> for outputting the old text format for MAST. Note that there are some
                  problems with backwards compatibility in separate scoring mode. The use of the text format is no longer recommended.

                <li>
                  <code>psp-gen</code> --<br />
                  added <code>psp-gen</code> and integrated PSP generation into web service.

                <li>
                  <code>MHMM</code> --<br />
                  Fixed bug in <code>--order</code> option.
                  The option was handling motifs with strand identifiers incorrectly.
                </li>
                <li><code>TOMTOM</code> -- <br />
                  Added <code>-no-ssc</code> switch to fix problem with
                  motifs with few sites having empty logos; this switch is now
                  the default for the TOMTOM website.</li>
                <li><code>GOMO</code> --<br />
                  Improved gomo html format.
                  Added highlighting of the most specific GO terms in 
                  the html output. This is activated by the switch --dag
                  which expects a GO DAG file.</li>
                <li><code>gomo_highlight</code> --<br />
                  Added a program to post process gomo xml files to
                  identify the go terms which are implied by other
                  more specific go terms to allow the specific terms
                  to be highlighted in the html output. This is used 
                  by gomo when the --dag switch is specified.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>obo2dag</code> --<br />
                  Added a tool for generating a GO DAG file from a
                  Gene Ontology OBO file.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>GO DAG format</code> --<br />
                  Documented the new GO DAG file format and improved GOMO 
                  documentation as well as the command line overview.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>GLAM2</code> -- <br />
                  The output now prints a regular expression in addition to the logo
                  for each motif found.
                </li>
                <li>
                <code>MEME motif format</code> --<br />

                Added comparative genomics to GOMO.  GOMO can now use
                multiple, comparative genomes in making its predictions.
                This substantially increases the sensitivity of predictions of roles
                for DNA binding motifs.  The GOMO web-service now
                uses GC-compensated AMA <i>p</i>-values.

    <br />
                AMA can now compute GC-content compensated <i>p</i>-values.
                The GC-content of an individual sequence is used in estimating
                the <i>p</i>-value of its AMA score.

            </p>
            <p>This is the <b>12th year of MEME development</b>. The current anniversary
            maintenance release 
               for MEME contains a number of improvements to the installation and configuration of MEME/MAST 
               servers and clients. Thanks to Nadya Williams of SDSC/NBCR for this work.

                <b>Refactoring of installation and configuration</b> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Restructure source directory tree to ease configuration.</li>
                  <li>Highly simplified and optimized installation and configuration for MEME and MAST servers 
                      and clients using GNU autoconf/automake tools. </li>
                  <li>Multiple configuration options available via arguments to "configure".</li>
                  <li>Default installation of MEME, MAST server and clients, as well as the web
                  site.</li>
                  <li>Separate installation of server, client or web site if desired.</li>
                  <li>Create a small test suite for 'make test'.</li>
                  <li>Implement procedures for standard 'configure', 'make', 'make test', and 'make
                  install'.</li>
                  <li>Create scripts to run MEME/MAST servers as services, and automatically restarted them 
                      when physical host server reboots. Currently, Linux and SunOS are supported.</li>
                  <li>Simplified start of the servers with 'start-mast' and 'start-meme' scripts.</li>
                  <li>Encapsulate site-specific variables in Globals.pm for perl scripts 
                      and in meme_config for sh scripts.</li>
                  <li>Add csh and sh configuration scripts to set working environment.</li>
                  <li>Availability as a Rocks Roll for integration with 
                      <a href="http://www.rocksclusters.org">Rocks based cluster system</a>.</li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Enhancements</b> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Sent MEME/MAST search results via an email as attachments, rather than inlined in the 
                      message body. This allows the MEME output to be saved properly for subsequent 
                      use with MetaMEME. It also reduces the chance of the output being modified by email 
                      filters.</li>
                  <li>Check email addresses for entry accuracy using javascript. Thanks to Chris 
                      Misleh of NBCR for this feature.</li>
                  <li>Check email addresses for valid domain names.</li>
                  <li>Create new 'runtests' script to run all test suites. Simplify parsing of the
                  output.</li>
                  <li>Update FAQ(s) for MEME and MAST.</li>
                  <li>Separate web-related files by type (html, cgi or image) and create a dir structure 
                      to support it. This simplifies web maintenance.</li>
                  <li>Add examples of database and motif sequences files.</li>

                <b>Known Issues</b> 
                <ul>

                  <li>The new meme and mast are binary executables, not shell scripts as they used to be. 
                      When run with the appropriate arguments, they produce text (non-html) output. To get 
                      the "old" behavior of meme and mast with the html output, use meme.csh and mast.csh 
                      (without -text option). The following table gives new vs. old usage comparison. 
            <pre>

                    the MEME HTML output document in an HTML-capable email reader or

                    the statistical significance of the log likelihood ratio of the
                    occurrences of the motif.

                  <li>
                    <b>E-values:</b>  MEME computes and reports the statistical significance
                    of motifs as the E-value of the log likelihood ratio.  This provides
                    an objective measure of how likely the motif is to be biologically

                    OOPS, ZOOPS and TCM.

                  <li>
                    <b>Handling of ambiguous characters:</b>  MEME now handles ambiguous
                    DNA and protein letters by converting them to the character "X". 
                    MEME treats the "X" character as "unknown", and correctly computes
                    the probabilities of motif occurrences containing it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Higher-order background models:</b> MEME now allows the user to
                    specify a Markov model of arbitrary order via a file of tuple 
                    frequencies.  This appears to improve the ability to discriminate 
                    between biologically interesting DNA motifs and motifs that are 
                    artifacts of the higher order statistics of DNA sequence.

                    <b>Multiple-alignment-based motif trimming:</b>  
                    MEME defines a motif as
                    a set of subsequences that can be correctly aligned without gaps.
                    MEME can now trim
                    the edges of motifs based on a local multiple alignment with gaps.  MEME
                    first determines the occurrences of the motif, then aligns each
                    occurrence to the highest-scoring occurrence.  These are combined
                    into a multiple alignment, and MEME looks for a set of columns with
                    no gaps.  If a set of gapless columns at least &lt;minw&gt; wide is not
                    found, MEME searches for a set with at most 1, 2, ... etc gaps until
                    a set is found.

                    <b>Prior distribution on the number of occurrences:</b>  MEME now
                    places a prior on the number of occurrences that controls how
                    strong the bias towards motifs with a given number of sites is.
                    Using a prior improves the performance of MEME with DNA, where the
                    megaprior heuristic (used by default with protein sequences),
                    is not applicable.

                      <li> 
                        You can now give the name of a file containing your sequences 
                        instead of having to cut-and-paste the sequences themselves.
                      </li>
                      <li> 
                        You may ask MEME to favor wide motifs instead of the (default) narrow
                        motifs;  this is especially useful with small sequence sets (fewer than
                        10 sequences.)
                      </li>
                      <li> The on-line documentation of MEME has been expanded and improved.</li>
                      <li> 
                        MEME now determines the type of your sequences
                        (PROTEIN or DNA) automatically.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The MEME server now runs MAST on your sequences to make it easy for you 
                        to see the ordering and spacing of the motifs MEME discovered.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                     MAST allows accurate homology searches of databases using motifs generated
                     by MEME.  The scores from all motifs characterizing a family are combined,
                     normalized for sequence length, and sorted by z-score.  The output of MAST
                     is similar to that of BLAST, but, used in conjunction with MEME, MAST
                     allows searching for sequences related to an entire family, not just a
                     single sequence in the family.  This provides better sensitivity and
                     selectivity than single-sequence homology searches.
                     MAST is currently only available in the ftp-able code, not via the web server.
