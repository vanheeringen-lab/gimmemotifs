***************************************************************************
Quick Install of the MEME Suite on Linux, OS-X and Cygwin systems
***************************************************************************
1) Type the following commands and then follow the instructions
   printed by the "configure" command.

    $ tar zxf meme_VERSION.tar.gz
    $ cd meme_VERSION 
    $ ./configure --prefix=$home/meme --with-url="http://meme.nbcr.net/meme"

2) Edit your shell configuration file to add
    "$home/meme/bin"
  to your shell's path.

Notes: 
 a) This installs only the command-line versions of programs. Refer
    to the complete installation guide (doc/meme-install.html) if
    you wish to install your own MEME Suite Web Service as well.
 b) This will overwrite any previously existing "$home/meme" directory
    you may have.  You can set the directory to something different in
    the "configure" command using the "--prefix" option.
 c) The HTML output of programs will contain buttons that send your
    data to "http://meme.nbcr.net" for additional processing when
    clicked.  See the complete installation guide (doc/meme-install.html)
    if you do not want this feature.

Full Installation Documentation
***************************************************************************
In prior versions, installation was driven by the interactive 
install script.  Starting with version 3.5.0 it is done using 
GNU autoconf and automake tools. Instructions for the versions
prior to 3.5.0 are included in the corresponding INSTALL file 
for that version.

For versions 3.5.0 and above please see the "doc/meme-install.html" 
file for the installation instructions. This file is also available online 
at http://meme.nbcr.net/doc/meme-install.html and it corresponds to 
the latest available version of MEME.
