      <h1>mhmm</h1>
      <p><b>Usage:</b> mhmm [options] &lt;<i>MEME file</i>&gt;</p>
      <p><b>Description:</b></p>
      <p>This program creates motif-based hidden Markov models
      (HMMs) of families of related biosequences. The program takes as
      input a set of DNA or protein motif models constructed by <a href=
      "http://meme.sdsc.edu">MEME</a> and produces as output a single
      HMM containing the given motifs. <code>mhmm</code> can produce
      three types of models: linear models, in which the motifs are
      arranged like beads on a string, completely connected models, which
      allow for repetitions of motifs and for motifs to appear in any
      order, and star models. <code>mhmm</code> writes its output in a
      format readable by the other Meta-MEME programs, <a href=
      "mhmms.html">mhmms</a> and <a href="mhmmscan.html">mhmmscan</a>.
      <p>Three types of models may be produced. A linear motif-based HMM
      consists of a sequence of motif models, each separated by one or
      more tied insert states that represent the spacer region between
      motifs. A completely connected model, on the other hand, includes
      transitions from the end of each motif to the beginning of every
      other motif in the model (with a spacer model along each
      transition). This more general topology allows for motifs that are
      repeated, deleted or shuffled. A star model is also available. By
      default, the program produces a linear model.</p>
      <p>Transition probabilities among motifs are derived from the motif
      occurence information in the given MEME file. For the completely
      connected topology, this information is derived from all of the
      motif occurences. For the linear topology, the information is
      derived only from the best-scoring sequence. Alternatively, the
      order and spacing of motifs within a linear model may be specified
      via the "--order" option.</p>
      </p>
      <p><b>Input:</b></p>
      <ul>
      <li>&lt;<i>MEME file</i>&gt; - a file containing one or more motifs
      in <a href="meme-format.html">MEME format</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Output:</b></p>
      <p><!-- START OUTPUT -->
      <p><b>The Meta-MEME model file contains the following
      information:</b></p>
      <ul>
      <li>The Meta-MEME version number and release date.</li>
      <li>The program name, file contents and date the file was
      created.</li>
      <li>A link to the Meta-MEME home page.</li>
      <li>A reference to cite if you publish results from Meta-MEME.</li>
      <li>Some global information about the Meta-MEME model.</li>
      <li>A list of the states in the Meta-MEME model.</li>
      <li>The matrix of transition probabilities between states of the
      model.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>HMM Global Information</b></p>
      <p>
      The list of states in the Meta-MEME model begins with eight lines
      that specify the global characteristics of the model. These lines
      tell
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>whether the model has a linear or completely connected topology
      (i.e., whether the model allows for repetition and shuffling of
      motifs),</li>
      <li>the total number of states in the model,</li>
      <li>the total number of spacers (i.e., inter-motif regions) in the
      model,</li>
      <li>the number of states used to represent each spacer,</li>
      <li>the number of letters in the alphabet (4 for DNA and 20 for
      amino acids),</li>
      <li>the alphabet,</li>
      <li>the background frequencies used as emission probabilities in
      the spacer states, and</li>
      <li>the name of the MEME output file that was used to generate this
      Meta-MEME model.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>HMM States</b></p>
      <p>Following the global characteristics is a list of state
      descriptions. Each state description consists of six lines. These
      lines tell</p>
      <ul>
      <li>the index of the state (numbered from 0),</li>
      <li>the type of state (i.e, whether it is a start or end state, a
      spacer state, or the beginning, middle or end of a motif),</li>
      <li>the index of the motif within which this state appears (This
      value is arbitrarily set to -1 for non-motif states.),</li>
      <li>the position of the state within the motif or spacer region,
      and</li>
      <li>the letter that is printed above this state when the MEME motif
      ID is printed centered with respect to the motif,</li>
      <li>the list of probabilities that this state will emit each of the
      letters in the alphabet.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The final item (the list of emission probabilities) is omitted
      from the start and end states, which do not emit letters.</p>
      <p><b>Transition probability matrix</b></p>
      <p>The Meta-MEME model file ends with a square matrix containing n
      rows and n columns, where n is the number of states in the model.
      The entry in row i, column j of this matrix is the probability of
      transitioning from state i to state j in the model. Consequently,
      each row in the matrix sums to 1.0.</p>
      <!-- END OUTPUT --></p>
      <p><b>Options:</b></p>
      <p>The program allows five different ways of selecting motifs from
      the input file. The default method is to select all the motifs. The
      first four command-line options provide alternative means of
      selecting motifs. All of these four options are mutually
      exclusive.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>--motif &lt;<i>motif #</i>&gt; - This option (which may be
      repeated) allows the user to select a specific motif for inclusion
      in the HMM. The specified motif number corresponds to the motif
      index in the MEME file.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--nmotifs &lt;<i>n</i>&gt; - This option is similar to the
      '-motif' option, except that it tells <code>mhmm</code> to use the
      first n motifs in the given MEME file.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--ethresh &lt;<i>E-value</i>&gt; - This option sets an E-value
      threshold for inclusion of motifs in the model. Motifs with
      E-values below the specified value are ignored.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--lowcomp &lt;<i>threshold</i>&gt; - Eliminate low-complexity
      motifs from the model. Motif complexity is the average K-L distance
      between the "motif background distribution" and each column of the
      motif. The motif background is just the average distribution of all
      the columns. The K-L distance, which measures the difference
      between two distributions, p and f, is the same as the information
      content:
      <center>p<sub>1</sub> log(p<sub>1</sub>/f<sub>1</sub>) +
      p<sub>2</sub> log(p<sub>2</sub>/f<sub>2</sub>) + ... +
      p<sub>n</sub> log(p<sub>n</sub>/f<sub>n</sub>).</center>
      This value increases with increasing complexity.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--order &lt;<i>string</i>&gt; - This option instructs
      <code>mhmm</code> to build an HMM with linear topology. The given
      string specifies the order and spacing of the motifs within the
      model, and has the format "l=n=l=n=...=l=n=l", where "l" is the
      length of a region between motifs, and "n" is a motif index. Thus,
      for example, the string "34=3=17=2=5" specifies a two-motif linear
      model, with motifs 3 and 2 separated by 17 letters and flanked by
      34 letters and 5 letters on the left and right. If the MEME file
      contains motif occurrences on both strands, then the motif IDs in
      the order string should be preceded by "+" or "-" indicating the
      strandedness of the motif.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--type [linear|complete|star] - A linear motif-based HMM
      consists of a sequence of motif models, each separated by one or
      more tied insert states that represent the spacer region between
      motifs. A completely connected model, on the other hand, includes
      transitions from the end of each motif to the beginning of every
      other motif in the model (with a spacer model along each
      transition). This more general topology allows for motifs that are
      repeated, deleted or shuffled. By default, the program produces a
      linear model. The order and spacing of motifs in the model is
      determined by the single sequence with the lowest E-value.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--pthresh &lt;<i>p-value</i>&gt; - This option sets a p-value
      threshold for inclusion of motif occurences in the transition
      probability matrix used to construct the HMM.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--nspacer &lt;<i>value</i>&gt; - By default, <code>mhmm</code>
      models each spacer using a single insert state. The distribution of
      spacer lengths produced by a single insert state is exponential in
      form. A more reasonable distribution would be a bell-shaped curve
      such as a Gaussian. Modeling the length distribution explicitly is
      computationally expensive; however, a Gaussian distribution can be
      approximated using multiple insert states to represent a single
      spacer region. The '--nspacer' option specifies the number of
      insert states used to represent each spacer. Note that this
      Gaussian approximation is only effective in conjunction with total
      probability training and scoring.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--transpseudo &lt;<i>value</i>&gt; - Specify the value of the
      pseudocount used in converting transition counts to transition
      probabilities.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--spacerpseudo &lt;<i>value</i>&gt; - Specify the value of the
      pseudocount used in converting transition counts to spacer
      self-loop probabilities.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--description &lt;<i>text</i>&gt; - Specify descriptive text to
      be stored as a comment in the model file.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--fim - A free-insertion module (FIM) is an insert state with
      1.0 probability of self-transition and 1.0 probability of exit
      transition. Thus, traversing such a state has zero transition cost.
      Specifying this option causes all spacers to be represented using
      FIMs.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--keep-unused - By default, <code>mhmm</code> remove from the
      transition probability matrix all inter-motif transitions that are
      not observed in the data. This option allows those transitions to
      be retained. This option is only relevant if the model has a
      completely connected topology.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--verbosity 1|2|3|4|5 - Set the verbosity level of the output
      to stderr. The default level is 2.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--noheader - Do not put a header on the output file.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--noparams - Do not list the parameters at the end of the
      output.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--notime - Do not print the running time and host name at the
      end of the output.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none"></li>
      <li>--quiet - Combine the previous three flags and set verbosity to
      1.</li>
